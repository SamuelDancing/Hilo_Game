# Description
---
Sometimes Solitare is a little to complex, but you don't have a friend to play TicTacToe while you wait for that one project to compile. Hilo is a quick and easy card game. Just bid high or low, and see if you're lucky. If you guess right, you get 100 points. If you guess wrong, you lose 75. See if you can reach 10,000 points!

# Required Software

# To play

Run the __main__.py file. If any files are moved, it will not run.
Use l to bid low, and h to bid high. Guess correctly to gain more points.
